Business problem

What if we could look at specific important/busy areas in the city or place of interest of a city we are visiting.
In that case what if we could cluster neighbourhoods on the basis of the potential tourism interests.
It would help travellers, tourism agencies and real estate investors too.

Explanation

Toronto is a fast growing financial hub. With increasing city centres and sparling residential hubs. This
makes tourism and real estate one of many growing business ventures Toronto has had. The city is
well connected and well planned and is financially flourishing and that aspect brings in a lot of
travellers. Hence determining interests and hotspots is definitely beneficial and aids new tourists and
investors

Stakeholders

Anyone who's interested in the region, it can be individuals, tourists or even the residents who would
want to know if they are in the right neighbourhood
